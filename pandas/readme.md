# NYCflights13 Dataset Showdown: Pandas vs SQL

Welcome to the ultimate showdown between Pandas and SQL with the NYCflights13 dataset! Get ready to witness the battle of the data wrangling titans, where we'll dive into 336,776 flights departing from the Big Apple in 2013.

## Data Description

In one corner, we have Pandas, the Python library known for its flexibility and ease of use. Armed with its DataFrame arsenal, Pandas will take on the challenge of wrangling the NYCflights13 dataset. Can it handle the task with grace and efficiency?

And in the other corner, we have SQL, the tried-and-true database query language. With its powerful JOINs and aggregation functions, SQL is ready to go head-to-head with Pandas. Will its structured approach to data manipulation prevail?
